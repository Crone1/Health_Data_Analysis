# Overview
This project focused on the analysis and the derivation of impactful insights from health data.
This work was carried out as part of one of my college modules focusing on the use of Data Science through different application domains.
This particular domain tuches on the health of university students as judged by their sleep, their excercise, the food they eat, and their interactions with their college platform.
We were tasked with this project as a pilot for a new module that *Dublin City University (DCU)* will be running next year to help students improve their quality of life.

# File Contents

### Data
The data for this analysis can be found in the *'Data'* folder.
This folder is then broken down into the sleep data, the food data, the activity data, and the loop data.
Each data folder only contains 7 students, which is a very small scale.

### Code
The analysis itself is done in the *'Flourish_data_analysis.ipynb'* jupyter notebook.
This notebook reads the functions needed for this analysis from the *'data_analysis_functions.py'* file.

### Presentation
Some of the most important analysis and the process followed is detailed in the *'Brief_Analysis_Presentation.pptx'* powerpoint document.
This was a short 10-minute summary presentation of the project.
